#E-movie ticket reservation system

This project was developed to demonstrate the JDBC and ODBC connection between java swings as being front end and Oracle as the backend for storing Users database alongwith Movies and the seats reserved.

Every user is given certain options for selecting where we make sure that the current user cannot book the prevously booked seats for same show by disabling the reserved seats.

##Note:
There might be part of code where the fields might be hard-coded like table name and filename etc.
